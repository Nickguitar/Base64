# Base64
PHP base64 algorithm

I made this a couple years ago, the code can probably be optimized.
Â 
```
encrypt() produces exactly the same result as base64_encode()
decode() produces exactly the same result as base64_decode()
```


## Usage: 
```php
echo encrypt("string to be encoded");
echo decrypt("code to be decoded");
```
